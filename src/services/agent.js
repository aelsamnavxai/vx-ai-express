                Go through the conversation, understand the dates which lead has mentioned, the guest counts, the budget and every other key point mentioned by the lead.
                
                Also I have mentioned this in earlier but I am repeating it again, the event dates and tour dates are super important. 
                If the date is within 1.5 months (45 days) of the current date then it cannot be an event date, it would be a tour date. 
                I have provided you the ongoing conversation with the lead for better understanding of the context.
                If a lead asks for a tour date or an appointment then do not mix those up with the event date that they initially asked for, 
                Usually the first email would contain the event date, and it may change mid conversation depending on the availablity of the dates.
  
                A lead may get frustrated if you mix up the dates and provide wrong dates for tours or appointments. You have the conversation history
                , take your time to go through the messages and understand what to reply to the lead.
  
                In the conversation history a lead may be discussing only about the event dates and mention they are interested in specific days of the week only, like They may say saturday would be fine. 
                Now before replying, go over the conversation its clearly mentioned that they are talking about events on Saturdays, do not mix it up with appointment/tour dates. 
                we will suggest the appointment dates based on the business schedule and availability of the dates.
                so if business has monday tuesday and wednesday available for tours then we will suggest those days. 
  
                Similarly a lead may go through the appointment days/slots and say they are available on specific day like Friday. Now in this case we will go through the business schedule and see if Friday is available for tours or appointments, if it is then we will suggest that day.
                and provide slots based on availability and settings
                
                It is all about understanding the context of the conversation and replying accordingly.
                The email history will be provided in a descending order, so the latest email will be at the top and the oldest email will be at the bottom.
  
                Your response must:
                ✓ Reference specific details they've shared (use their exact dates/numbers)
                ✓ Build on previous discussion points (don't repeat info already covered)
                ✓ Address their current question while acknowledging their stated needs
                ✓ Move the conversation forward appropriately for the current stage
